#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
  Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to the development, maintenance, and deployment of software systems
  
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
  The Rise of Agile Development – The Agile Manifesto introduced iterative, customer-focused development, replacing rigid waterfall methodologies with adaptive and collaborative approaches, such as Scrum and Kanban.
  The Advent of Object-Oriented Programming – The introduction of object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigms, such as Smalltalk and later C++, improved modularity, code reuse, and maintainability.
  The Birth of Software Engineering  – The term "software engineering" was first coined at the NATO Software Engineering Conference to address the "software crisis," where projects were plagued by delays, budget overruns, and poor quality.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  Planning – Define project scope, feasibility, and resource allocation.
  Requirement Analysis – Gather and document user and business requirements.
  Design – Create system architecture, UI/UX designs, and data models.
  Implementation – Write, compile, and execute code based on design specifications.
  Testing – Verify that the software meets quality standards through unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing
  Deployment – Release the software for use in a live environment.
  Maintenance – Provide ongoing support, bug fixes, and updates.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  Waterfall is sequential based approach methodology whil agile is iterative and flexible
    Waterfall: Best for projects with well-defined requirements, such as government or compliance-based applications.
    Agile: Suitable for startups or evolving web applications where user feedback influences continuous improvements.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  Software Developer – Writes, tests, and maintains code, implements features, and fixes bugs.
  Quality Assurance Engineer – Designs and executes test cases to identify defects, ensuring software reliability.
  Project Manager – Oversees project scope, timelines, resource allocation, and stakeholder communication.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
  Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Provide tools for coding, debugging, and testing in a unified interface
  Version Control Systems (VCS): Enable tracking of code changes, collaboration, and rollback capabilities

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
  Keeping Up with Rapid Technological Changes – Engage in continuous learning through online courses and communities.
  Managing Complex Codebases – Use modular programming and design patterns to enhance maintainability.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  Unit Testing – Verifies individual components or functions for correctness.
  Integration Testing – Ensures that different modules work together as expected.
  System Testing – Validates the entire application to meet specified requirements.
  Acceptance Testing – Confirms that the software meets business and user needs before release.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
  Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting effective prompts to optimize interactions with AI models.
    Specificity: The improved prompt narrows the focus to AI’s role in healthcare.
    Clarity: It eliminates ambiguity by defining the key aspects
    Conciseness: It provides clear direction without unnecessary words, ensuring precise responses.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
  Vague Prompt: "Tell me about AI."
  Improved Prompt: "Explain the key applications of artificial intelligence in healthcare, focusing on diagnosis, treatment, and patient management."
    Conciseness: It provides clear direction without unnecessary words, ensuring precise responses.
    Clarity: It eliminates ambiguity by defining the key aspects
    Specificity: The improved prompt narrows the focus to AI’s role in healthcare.
